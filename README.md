RelayPi
=======
This is a set of php/python scripts to allow control of a Sainsmart (or other relay) via web or an IR sensor.
I used the following hardware:
RasperryPi Model B, 256mb ram.
SainSmart 2 channel relay module. http://www.sainsmart.com/arduino-pro-mini.html
Pololu Sharp IR Distance Sensor (~2 inch distance) with Carrier. http://www.pololu.com/product/1132
Breadboard, wiring as needed.


Wiring Setup
=======
Raspberry Pi      IR sensor
3v3     <------->  VIN
GND     <------->  GND
GPIO 23 <------->  OUT

Raspberry Pi      Relay Module
				   Leave JD-VCC and VCC jumper
5v5     <------->  VCC
GND     <------->  GND
GPIO24  <------->  IN1

Software
========
Once hardware has been assembled and tested, run setup.sh to install the daemon and web pages.
It requires php5, curl, python 2.7. Setup will install these automatically.
